Key Features in This Chatbot:



Friendly Personality: The chatbot has a name ("Charlie") and responds in a casual, friendly manner. It makes the interaction feel more like you're talking to a human.

Memory: The chatbot can remember your previous message during the session. You can ask it "remember what I said?" to recall the last thing you mentioned.

Humor: The bot tells jokes when you ask it to, making the interaction more engaging.

Context Awareness: It responds to your input in context. If you say "hi", it doesnâ€™t just respond with a generic greeting, but adds personality and variety to its response.

Exit Option: If you say "bye", the chatbot ends the conversation with a friendly farewell.

How It Works:
When you run the script, it will greet you and wait for your input.

You can interact with it by typing different messages like "hi", "how are you", "tell me a joke", or even ask it to "remember what I said?".

The bot will respond based on what you've said, and it keeps track of the conversation context until you say "bye", which ends the chat.
